## Ciphers

### Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher is one of the most straightforward encryption techniques, involving a simple letter shift.

### Vigen√®re Cipher

The Vigen√®re cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword for encryption, making it more secure than the Caesar cipher.

### Playfair Cipher

The Playfair cipher employs a 5x5 matrix to encrypt letters in pairs, providing better security compared to basic substitution ciphers.

### Atbash Cipher

The Atbash cipher is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher that replaces each letter with its reverse in the alphabet.

### Railfence Cipher

The Railfence cipher is a transposition cipher that rearranges letters in a zigzag pattern for encryption and decryption.

### Beaufort Cipher

The Beaufort cipher is similar to the Vigen√®re cipher but uses a subtraction-based approach for encryption.

### Affine Cipher

The Affine cipher combines multiplication and addition to encrypt plaintext, adding an extra layer of security.

## Algorithms

### RSA Algorithm

RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman) is a widely-used asymmetric encryption algorithm. It employs a public-private key pair for secure communication and digital signatures.

## Steganography

Steganography is the art of concealing information within other data, such as hiding messages within images or audio files for covert communication and data protection.
